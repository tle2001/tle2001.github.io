Well here is my own page and I will upload some personal project here. 
In this webpage, I focus on my work in the field of Computer Science and Data Analytics. 

I was influenced by Huan Truong, a blogger from Spiderum and my old friend Dang Chinh in designing and creating this blog. Since I am a Economic student, I think it would be nice if I have something to work in spare time through the rest of my college life, then I create this blog to upload my own works, j4f.

If you want to contact me, please check Github and Linkedin links below this article and have a good day!

Thanh Le.
